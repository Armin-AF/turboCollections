- Dynamic resizing of the internal array to accommodate new elements.
- Efficient memory usage by minimizing reallocations.
- Fast access to elements by index.
- Support for common list operations like adding, removing, setting, and clearing elements.
- Additional methods for searching, checking containment, and iterating.
